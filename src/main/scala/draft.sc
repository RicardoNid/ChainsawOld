getSeqFromText("Chainsaw is an open-source framework based on  **D**ata-**F**low **G**raph and , presented as a extension library SpinalHDL, a HGL(like Chisel). Design flow of data-driven hardware is divided into three levels: algorithm, architecuture, and operators. For alogrithm, We provide utilities to convert a problem from its original form to a strength-reduced, filtering-based form. For architecture, users could build their hardware on customized/pre-built DFGs, and thus could do automatic folding, unfolding and pipelining/retiming to achieve different performance level. And for operator level, customized/pre-built arithmetic operators for different technologies serve as the building blocks. Besides, as data-driven applications are highly patterned,  off-the-shelf simultaion suite and pre-designed scripts for FPGAs are also provided.").size
